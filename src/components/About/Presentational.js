            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Im a website developer from Albania.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>I decided to change my work 3 years ago when i started studing programming.
            I have become interested in this field since always and coding is the perfect job for me. 
            My knowledges are focused in developing applications with React Js.
            Helping tech-constrained creative teams pitch & 
            deliver more ambitious brand activations and experiential software development apps to 
            their clients.
            Iâ€™ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side.  
            I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code.
            As a bonus, being both designer and developer allows me to make sure no 
            detail is lost in translation.
